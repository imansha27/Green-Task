The garbage collection management system is a web-based platform designed to help Green Task 
Force members report the incidents that happen when throwing garbage. Each role has a 
different level of permission to access the website with limitations. The Webmaster can create 
accounts for the captains and collecting staff, as well as post articles and add garbage collection 
spots to the system. GTF Members can report incidents, while the Green Captain can view and 
approve/reject them, and collecting staff can view and collect garbage. There are 4 parties that 
are GTF members, the green captain, collecting staff, and general users. In the following topics 
we discussed how they are interacting with the website and how the website helps them to 
continue their work.
